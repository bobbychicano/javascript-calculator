A calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This calculator serves as an assigned project for The Odin Project and to calculate basic math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two numbers). (I.e. 7 * 5 = 35)

This project was completed over a period of 3 weeks and took many hours of research, coding, reviewing, problem-solving, and questions.

A good deal of effort was made to correct any code inconsistencies, bugs, and/or errors. I attempted to write the cleanest and most concise code that I could given my current skillset, and I am sure there are some of you out there that could write the application differently.

You can find the live application here:
